# Data Compression

Data compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. 
Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and 
eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits 
by identifying marginally important information and removing it. The process of reducing the size of a data file is 
popularly known as data compression.

This section presents lossless compression algorithms.
