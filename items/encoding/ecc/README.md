# Error-Correcting Code

Error-correcting code (ECC) is a method of detecting and correcting errors in data that is transmitted over a network. ECC works by adding extra bits to data that are used to detect and correct errors. ECC is commonly used in computer memory and storage systems to ensure data integrity.
