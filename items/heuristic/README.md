# Heuristic Algorithms

Heuristic algorithms are algorithms that are not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but they are guaranteed to find a solution that is good enough. They are used when the problem is too complex to be solved by exact algorithms, or when the exact algorithms are too slow.

This repository contains several variations of the solution to the problem of optimal resource allocation between computers
